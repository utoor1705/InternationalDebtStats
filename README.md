##InternationalDebtStats

In this project, we will analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015. The project will focus on the following elements;

The World Bank's international debt data
Finding the number of distinct countries
Finding out the distinct debt indicators
Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries
Country with the highest debt
Average amount of debt across indicators
The highest amount of principal repayments
The most common debt indicator
